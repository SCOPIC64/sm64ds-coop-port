// Host runtime: the frame clock, the interrupt state, and the thing that makes
// `VBlankIntrWait()` mean something off-hardware.
//
// A DS game is not a tick function. It runs a loop that blocks in the middle on
// VBlank, and 11,000 decompiled functions assume exactly that shape. Restructuring
// them into something a host frame loop can call is not on the table.
//
// So the game runs on its own fiber. VBlankIntrWait switches back to the host
// fiber, which ends the frame -- scan out, present, advance the clock -- and
// switches back. Game control flow is untouched, and nothing races, because only
// one fiber is ever running. The same mechanism generalises to OS_SleepThread /
// OS_WakeupThread when those are needed.

// every fade and read never. See port/irq2_map.txt for the derivation.

// seam, because an interrupt is not a fader: any handler registered for mask 2
