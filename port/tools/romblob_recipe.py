"""Turn the ROM-CLEAN manifest into an extraction recipe the portable kit ships.

ROM-CLEAN moved every ROM byte out of walk_window.exe and into
build/assets/romdata.bin, which the dev build generates from the repo's
extracted/ images. A player has no extracted/ -- only their own cartridge dump.
The portable kit's extract_assets.ps1 therefore needs to know, for every byte
range of romdata.bin, WHERE in the (decompressed) ROM images that range lives.
That mapping is this file's output: romdata.recipe.tsv, shippable because it
holds only names, offsets and hashes -- zero Nintendo bytes.

    python tools/romblob_recipe.py <manifest> <recipe_out>

Every manifest `sym` row resolves to (source image, source offset):

    tag romdata     -> extracted/arm9_dec.bin, offset = addr - 0x02004000
    tag ovNNN_syms  -> overlay NNN, offset = addr - base_address(NNN)
    tag ovNNN       -> port_ovNNN_image is the whole image at offset 0;
                       any other name resolves like ovNNN_syms (ov002's
                       from-list part carries the tag ov002)

Addresses come from config/arm9/symbols.txt / config/arm9/overlays/*/
symbols.txt, falling back to the _02xxxxxx hex embedded in generated names.
This script does NOT trust its own resolution: every recipe row is sliced out
of the local extracted images and hashed against the manifest's per-sym sha,
the rows must tile the blob exactly, and the re-concatenation must hash to the
manifest's whole-file sha. A mismatch names the symbol and exits non-zero, so
a wrong recipe cannot be produced silently.
