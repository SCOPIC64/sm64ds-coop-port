/* The WATER_BOMB's (WaterBomb / daWbm_c, actor 208, ov098) three-state table
 * seat, the Cap_StateDispatch / Cannon_Behavior treatment.
 *
 * WaterBomb::Behavior reads a {function, adjustment} pair out of
 * data_ov098_0213c930[unk_3c4] and calls it -- an mwcc pointer-to-member table
 * read as a plain function pointer. The three entries are seeded by
 * __sinit_ov098_0213c2b4 (linked in hal/actor_overlays.cpp), which copies three
 * SOURCE statics into the runtime table:
 *
 *     data_ov098_0213c930[0] = data_ov098_0213c724   -> func_ov098_0213b9d8
 *     data_ov098_0213c930[1] = data_ov098_0213c72c   -> func_ov098_0213bb1c
 *     data_ov098_0213c930[2] = data_ov098_0213c71c   -> func_ov098_0213b7e8
 *
 * The .fn words the mount ships for those three statics are the overlay image's
 * own -- DS CODE ADDRESSES (0213b9d8 / 0213bb1c / 0213b7e8), the ovdata
 * contract, matched by config/arm9/overlays/ov098/relocs.txt. Calling one jumps
 * into unbuilt DS memory, which is the fault the census caught the first frame a
 * WATER_BOMB reached WaterBomb::Behavior (FAULT accessing 0213b9d8).
 *
 * The seat rewrites the three SOURCE statics before the sinit copies them (the
 * LakituBro / Cap reading: one less mapping to get wrong than reseating the
 * runtime table after), each checked against the ROM address its host body was
 * compiled from -- a mount pointing at the wrong bytes says so instead of
 * calling into the overlay image. All three .delta halves are 0 (the
 * non-virtual complete-class form, confirmed against the overlay bytes), so the
 * pair is just the function pointer, and all three functions are matched src
 * (func_ov098_0213b7e8/9d8/bb1c), so there is no hole here: no state traps.
